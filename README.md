# MediaWikiAGE

**MAGE** (MediaWiki Automated Graphical Editor) is a MediaWiki API client mostly meant to be a replacement for AutoWikiBrowser (AWB).

This app is in heavy stages of production and isn't ready to be used yet.

## Project setup
You will need:
* Git
* Node.js (version 14+; version 12 is no longer supported)
* A package manager, such as [pnpm](https://pnpm.js.org/)

To start writing code, please fork the repository on GitHub first. This will be needed to send pull requests, which is how this project accepts patches.

```
# Clone the repository
git clone <URL to your fork>

# Enter the cloned folder
cd MAGE

# Install needed dependencies (use npm/yarn if you want)
pnpm install

# Run the application
pnpm run electron:serve
```
